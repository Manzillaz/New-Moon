          <h2 class="block1__h2">by Ian McDonald</h2>
          <p class="block1__text">It’s not that I don’t admire a lot of what McDonald’s doing here. There’s the worldbuilding, and the sense of creating a bigger world. The permissiveness of lunar society, and the ordinariness of its queerness. And his characters are interesting. I want to be able to like them more than I do. (I have a feeling I may have liked them more in the first volume, on rather less exposure.) But in the end, Luna: Moon Rising leaves me cold and unsatisfied, and doesn’t leave me feeling like the story has come to a resolution.</p>

              <p>Award-winning author Ian McDonald began his Luna trilogy in Luna: New Moon, and continued it in Luna: Wolf Moon. Now, in Luna: Moon Rising, the trilogy reaches its conclusion as the war that has raged between the Five Dragons of the Moon (and now has drawn representatives of Earth into the fray) enters its newest stage.</p>
              <p>There’s just one major problem with Luna: Moon Rising: it doesn’t feel like a conclusion. It feels, in fact, a lot more like a prologue, like the end of an opening act of some much larger arc. For every thread that’s brought to some kind of conclusion, another one spreads its wings.
              </p>
              <p>Let me state for the record that Luna: Moon Rising is not a good book to read out of sequence. It doesn’t stand alone. I’ve read the two preceding volumes in order (and lost a little detail to memory, as one does) and still feel a little lost among the variety of characters—many with similar names—and factions in play on the Moon. There is both a helpful glossary and a dramatis personae at the back of the book, but the actual assistance this provides in practice is rather limited.</p>
